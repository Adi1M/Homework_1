# Homework_1

## Homework on Data Ethics and Applied Analytics

### Day 1
Today I solved the first task, which included some challenges from LeetCode. Below are the links for all challenges, and you can find the answers in the `task_1.py` file. Please make sure to change the `print()` statements to `return` before submitting the answers.

- **Loops:** [Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/description/)
- **Arrays:** [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)
- **Sets and Dictionaries:** [Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/description/)

### Day 2
Today, I made some changes to Task 1 because I forgot to illustrate the logic behind my answers. Fortunately, I have a good friend who reminded me to draw it out. 

In addition, I wrote the code for Task 3, where I calculated the sum of the hour differences. My logic is simple and should be easy to understand.

I encountered some problems with understanding the code for Task 2, but once I grasped the concept and applied it to the formula, it became easier. Afterward, I tested it with example cases and used other cases as outliers for the threat scores.
