Homework on Data Ethics and Applied Analitics
Day 1: Today I solved the first task where we have some challenges from leetcode. There is the links for all challenges and from task_1.py file you can find the answers, but before submitting answers please make sure that you change the print() method to the return:
Loops: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/description/
Arrays: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/
Sets and Dictionaries: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/description/
Day 2: Today I did the some changes in task 1, because I forgot to draw the logic of my answers. Hopefully, I have good friend, who remind me to draw it. Except of that I wrote the code of task 3, where I should the sum of the hour difference. My logic is simple and I think not to hard to understand it.
